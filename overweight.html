            <h3>Overweight Treatment</h2><hr>
            <p>Your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less.</p>

            <p>You didn't put on extra weight overnight so it is equally unrealistic to take it off quickly. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.</p>

            <p>Here are some very simple changes that you can start today that will greatly improve your chances of weight loss success:</p>

            <p><strong>Eliminate Red Meat</strong><br>
                If foods like burgers are basic to your current diet, cutting out red meat can go a long way in helping you make healthier meal choices. Build your meals around fish or poultry.</p>

            <p><strong>Cut out fried foods</strong><br>
                Grill, bake, roast, broil or boil your food. This also means doing without French Fries and snack foods like Potato Strings, Chips,...</p>
            <p><strong>Start with a soup or a salad</strong><br>
                By starting dinner with a soup or salad, you will curb your hunger, which will in turn help you keep portion sizes in check and prevent you from overeating.</p>
            <P><strong>Stop Cola consumption</strong><br>
                For every 20 ounces of Coca-Cola you drink, you're consuming 250 calories. If you're trying to consume around 1500 calories a day in order to lose weight, you can blow your entire calorie budget on soda!
            </P>
            <p><strong>Drink water</strong><br>
                Reach for the goal of eight glasses a day. Even if you don't drink eight, you're drinking more than usual</p>
